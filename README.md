# SentimentBridge

**SentimentBridge** is a polyglot microservice for real-time sentiment analysis. It is part of the larger **Customer360 Insights** platform and enables downstream services to analyze the emotional tone of customer interactions using a fine-tuned BERT NLP model.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🌐 .NET 6 Web API for enterprise-ready request routing and validation
- ⚡ Python FastAPI microservice running a Hugging Face BERT model for NLP inference
- 🔌 REST-based communication between services
- 🐳 Dockerized for fast, reproducible deployment
- 📦 Easily pluggable into larger systems (Customer360, CRM, Feedback engines)

> `.NET 6` handles the API endpoint. It sends input text to `FastAPI`, which runs BERT inference and returns sentiment scores.

## 🔧 Technologies

* **.NET 8** – API layer, request routing
* **C#** – Application logic
* **Python 3.10** – Inference engine
* **FastAPI** – Lightweight Python web framework
* **Hugging Face Transformers** – Pre-trained BERT NLP model
* **Docker & Docker Compose** – Service containerization

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/customer360-platform.git
cd customer360-platform/analytics/sentimentbridge
```

### 2. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This spins up:

* `sentimentbridge-dotnet` (ASP.NET 6 API)
* `sentimentbridge-fastapi` (Python + BERT model)

### 3. Test the API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/sentiment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "I love this product, it works great!"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "label": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.9821
}
```
